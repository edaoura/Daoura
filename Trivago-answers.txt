For the implemantation of the test automation i used:

1- Java as the programming language
2- IntelliJ as the IDE
3- Maven as the build tool included in IntelliJ
4- TestNG as the assertion framework.  this module is included with maven. normally It shouldn't be installed separately.
5- WebDriver as the browser automation tool   (you can install it in windows over the cmd: C:\> choco install chromedriver)
choco o Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows,

All scenarios are in the module regressionTests.

For the point 5. i created 2 of 4 tests that compare the test result with the expected result:
i choose the number 1 and 2. the "search for location"  function and "contact" are important for the magazine,
because searching for a location where people can have vacations is the main object of trivago.
The contact function is the channel between the company and the clients. It is important to hear opinions of the client
for the improvements of the magazine.
